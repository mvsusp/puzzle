### Overview of Edge of Eternities Draft Pick Orders
Magic: The Gathering's *Edge of Eternities* (EOE) is a space-themed set released in August 2025, featuring mechanics like stations, warp, and cosmic archetypes. Draft pick orders focus on prioritizing removal, bombs, and synergy within the 10 two-color archetypes (e.g., White-Blue Artifacts, Black-Red Sacrifice). Based on comprehensive searches across the web and X, below is a compiled list of all identified articles specifically discussing or including draft pick orders for EOE Limited. I've prioritized those explicitly mentioning "pick order" or tier lists, while including closely related draft guides that incorporate pick strategies. Duplicates across sources have been consolidated.

Articles are grouped by source type for clarity, with key details like publication date, author (if available), and a brief summary. Note that some content overlaps with Sealed advice, but all include draft-specific pick insights.
